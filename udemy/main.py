Data Acquisition -> Data Cleaning Test Data Model Training and Building
Data is often split into 3 sets
Training Data, Validation Data, Test Data
Test Data is used to get some final performance metric
This course will use a train/test split
After going through the course then we will have the option to split to get 3 data sets
Classification Metrics
Correct or incorrect predictions
fit/train model on training data
Then test that model on testing data
Test Image from X_test and Correct Label from y_test
Repeat process for all the images in our X test data 
Accuracy - Most common classification metric
80/100
Useful when target classes are well balanced
Not a good choice with unbalanced classes
Recall - Ability of a model 
Precision
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix - TP, FN, FP, TN
